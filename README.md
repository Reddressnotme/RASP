# RASP (Reconstruct Ancestral State in Phylogenies) 

We have written RASP (Reconstruct Ancestral State in Phylogenies) software to implements Dispersal-Vicariance Analysis (S-DIVA), Lagrange (DEC model), Bayes-Lagrange, BayArea and Bayesian Binary MCMC (BBM)methods. RASP is easy-to-install on the Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms, provides a user-friendly graphical interface, and generates exportable graphical results.
In RASP, the module of S-DIVA analysis is modified from source code of DIVA 1.2 (Ronquist, 2001) and the MCMC analysis in BBM is modified from source code of Mrbayes 3.1.2 (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck, 2003). DEC model of geographic range evolution was described in Ree et al. (2005) and Ree & Smith (2008). DEC analysis is modified from source code of C++ version of Lagrange developed by Smith (2010). BayArea method was described in Landis et al. (2013)
